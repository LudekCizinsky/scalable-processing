## About 
This small project is an assignment in the course `Large Scale Data Analysis`
taken at [IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk/). Its goal is to
analyze [Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main) dataset using [spark](https://spark.apache.org/).
More specifically, the main goal was to test the following hypothesis:

> Can you identify a difference in the relationship between authenticity language (words
such as "authentic" or "legitimate" or their derived forms) and typically negative words
(like "dirty", "kitsch", "cheap", "rude", "simple" or similar), in restaurants serving south
american or south asian cuisine than in restaurants serving european cuisine? And to
what degree?
